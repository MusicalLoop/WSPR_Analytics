# WSPR_Analytics
**WSPR Analytics** is a standalone Python web application designed to retrieve WSPR (Weak Signal Propagation Reporter) data. You enter a Call Sign and time period, and it retrieves data from WSPR.live and displays it in a table for you to analyse. There is also an simple analyse option that provides some basic metrics.
